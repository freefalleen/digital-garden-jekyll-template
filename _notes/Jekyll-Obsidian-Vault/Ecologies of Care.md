>Without care practices applied within the design profession, as well as to the products it creates, there’s a chance that “care” might become just another buzzword, akin to the greenwashing that [brings us glazed, bird-killing buildings with LEED plaques in the lobby](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/16/1038097872/new-york-dead-birds), or architects dropping in to “solve” a neighborhood’s problems in a matter of weeks.
>“Too many architects are using care as the new red pill,” Cadogan wrote in a text message, “but instead of unsettling your old assumptions they just reinforce them. Somehow architects and architecture historians are treating it like the new skeleton key or an add-on that makes everything more humane and personable.”
