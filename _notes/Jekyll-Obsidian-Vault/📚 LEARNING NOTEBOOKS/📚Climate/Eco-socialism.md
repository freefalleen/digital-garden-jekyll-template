**Eco-socialism** (also known as **green socialism** or **socialist ecology**) is an [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology "Ideology") merging aspects of [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") with that of [green politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_politics "Green politics"), [ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology "Ecology") and [alter-globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter-globalization "Alter-globalization") or [anti-globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-globalization_movement "Anti-globalization movement"). Eco-socialists generally believe that the expansion of the [capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") system is the cause of [social exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion "Social exclusion"), [poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty "Poverty"), [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War "War") and [environmental degradation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation "Environmental degradation") through [globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization "Globalization") and [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism"), under the supervision of repressive [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)") and transnational structures.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-socialism#cite_note-Manifesto-1)

Eco-socialism asserts that the [capitalist economic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-socialism#cite_note-Magdoff-2): 30  Thus, according to this analysis, giving economic priority to the fulfillment of [human needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") while staying within ecological limits, as [sustainable development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development "Sustainable development") demands, is in conflict with the structural workings of capitalism.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-socialism#cite_note-Magdoff-2) By this logic, market-based solutions to ecological crises ([ecological economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_economics "Ecological economics"), [environmental economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_economics "Environmental economics"), [green economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_economy "Green economy")) are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism's structural failures.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-socialism#cite_note-Magdoff-2): 97  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-socialism#cite_note-Kovel-3): 173–87  Eco-socialists advocate for the succession of capitalism by Eco-socialism—an [egalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism "Egalitarianism") economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill [human needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights")—as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis, and hence the only path towards sustainability.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-socialism#cite_note-Kovelb-4): 163 

Eco-socialists advocate dismantling capitalism, focusing on [common ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ownership "Common ownership") of the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production") by freely associated producers, and restoring the [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons "Commons").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-socialism#cite_note-Manifesto-1)
