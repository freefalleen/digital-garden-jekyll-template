i chanced upon a thread today that was lamenting about how there're so many resources everywhere. note that here we aren't referring directly to an information overload. I believe we're talking about the number of resources being put together for something. 
I've been pondering for abit, about the act of putting together resources, and i wonder if it's not an act of catharsis. Of doing something despite. Despite not knowing exactly what helps but i hope this does. It is cathartic in the interim. A form in which we have agency over, and after time and energy is spent, we have something to show for, of which its form is easily understood - a collection of something put together for a purpose of answering certain questions or helping someone start with something. 

the answer to how is yes
