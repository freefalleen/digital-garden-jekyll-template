_“Until now American culture has been characterized by two opposing attitudes toward nature, rapacity and romance, and both keep us from the respectful intimacy that is needed.  It is only through our efforts that we can repair the damage done not only to the world but to ourselves.  We want a whole nature because we want whole selves, and we are scarcely unreasonable in this desire.  We feel dislocated in nature because we have not come to terms with our role, with engineering and with artifice, nor with our utter dependence on the given world.  We may long for something pure, instinctive, organic, when we must instead face the truth that everything we touch is thereby ‘artificial.’  And not just face it but celebrate it, because to live out a close relationship with nature may be to restore the reverence that makes us feel complete.”_ _The Thing Itself:  On the Search for Authenticity by River Todd_
