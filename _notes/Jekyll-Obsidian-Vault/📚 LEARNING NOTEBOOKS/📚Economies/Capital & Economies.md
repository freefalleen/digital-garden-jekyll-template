The energy of web3 is palpable, a frenzy, an exhilaration. Like a child learning a language, there is more that I understand that I know to reproduce, evaluate, and express. There is so much marinating. 

It feels like it got predictable, in a sense that many of us felt the predictable fatigue of the same habits and patterns of the market. And then some corner of the web -- i struggle to tell how much of a corner it is and how close it is to flooding the centre -- started to upend its own order and became weirdly wild. 

the tendencies to want to merge with the space to extract a certain belonging and a certain identity. 

Is it all hype and speculation? Is it an echo chamber brimming with idealism and promises? The short answer is, I don't know and I'm waiting to find out. 

***What I've experienced and I know with certainty, is that the web3 and crypto boom feels like one of the best times to rethink and re-examine what we know about money (capital, wealth), as well as value creation and distribution.***

For a long time, the most radical of money experiments were for me, the idea of gift economy and the existence of timebanking groups. 

Market Economies are _systems of exchange based on buying and selling things with money_. A market exchange is **specific, quantifiable, direct, immediate, founded upon an explicit agreement**.https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy 

***What is the gift economy?***
A system of exchange based of gift-giving. 
Positive-debt, 
The gift economy is not barter.

You might have seen once or more the popping up of pay-as-you-wish experiments. Often times, the experimenter/creator makes reference the experiment as offering an opportunity for the buyer/user/participant to engage in a personal conversation -- a negotiation/conversation about how much I'm able to pay and the amount of value i accord to the good/service that i would like to receive. What undergirds this is often the component of prompting the other person to reflect upon the market/monetary scripts and architecture that we're so used to that frames "purchasing". 

Currency innovation such as coming up with a community currency. or in the case of Time banks, time as currency 

***What are community currencies?***

These show up as expressions of economic ideology. *There's something broken about the current economic system, it is not to my fancy, I am not in the position to disrupt it, but I am in the position to run small experiments on my own or perhaps with others in proximity.* 

What is similar between the both of this 
- rethinking another form of value exchange that is non-financial 
- cuts through the market habits, makes us rethink notions of value, the true cost of something, and whether we are able to transcend the transactional nature of marketplaces into a more relational one. rethink price as a signal for value. 

Both of these tend to be soft, fuzzy, with some flavour and inkling of charity thrown in.

Incentive alignment 
Incentivize participation 
- how can we get users to come  
- how do we get users to stay 
- how do we get people to share, bring more people on board, grow the tribe 
- how do we get people to pay

Multiple Forms of Capital [[The 8 forms of capital]]

Many brilliant thinkers have for years on end written about money, and the rules around money that are quite somewhat invisible to us. I won't touch of that here as i'm still wrapping my head around it. 

These are some rules of the game that we hardly stop to question. 

Money is merely one form of capital out of 8. 

We are most concerned or familiar with the way financial capital flows. 

As I learnt, "without distinctions, we cannot see."

The homeless individual did not run out of money, he ran out of relationships. That line stuck with me for a long time.
