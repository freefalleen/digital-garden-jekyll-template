A [summary](https://commonsstrategies.org/ontology-as-a-hidden-driven-of-politics-and-policy-commoning-and-relational-approaches-to-governance/) of the reading: 
> Some of us have come to the conclusion that **commons governance should be informed by an ontology that is fundamentally oriented to processes and relations, called ‚Äúprocess-relational ontology.‚Äù** Such a framework could help us build more appropriate, commons-based institutions that leverage and honor our relationships.

>A few nuggets of wisdom harvested from the deep dive:
> -   Ontological concepts are really supra-verbal.
> -   Very little is possible when people become reactive due to misalignments of core beliefs and epistemologies.
> -   Political thought still views agents as rational subjects and interprets relations primarily in terms of cause and effect.

> 	A shift in ontological perspective, or OntoShift as we call it, helps us see human beings as deeply relational creatures who, in turn require different types of political and economic institutions than than one we have now. In markets, the central relationships are transient cash transactions among isolated individuals pursuing their ‚Äúrational self-interest.‚Äù With state power, we are treated as individual citizens whose chief duties are to pay taxes, vote, and be acquiescent. **There are very few institutions or legal regimes that affirmatively support the trust-building, sense of shared purpose, and creative innovation that commoning entails.**
