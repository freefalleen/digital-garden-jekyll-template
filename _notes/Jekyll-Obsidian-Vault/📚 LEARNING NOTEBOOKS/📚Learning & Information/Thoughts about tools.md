**Scenario 1 (Outward)**
**Scenario 2 (Inward)**[evergreen topic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)
Both of these scenarios involve searching through my notes, yet they have very different directionalities.

-   Outward is a conversation between myself and others.
    
-   Inward is a conversation between myself and myself over time.
    
-   Outward is in the moment.
    
-   Inward is long-term.
    
-   Outward is part of an ephemeral interaction.
    
-   Inward accumulates a durable body of work.
    
-   Outward relates my thoughts to others’ ideas.
    
-   Inward relates others’ ideas to my thoughts.
