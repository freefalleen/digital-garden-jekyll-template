The Feynman Technique is a method of learning that unleashes your potential and forces you to develop a deep understanding.

[Richard Feynman](https://fs.blog/intellectual-giants/richard-feynman/) was a Nobel prize-winning physicist. His real superpower, however, was his ability to explain complicated subjects to others in simple terms. He realized that jargon, vague words, and complexity reveal a lack of understanding.

There are four key steps to the Feynman Technique:

1.  Choose a concept you want to learn about
2.  Explain it to a 12 year old
3.  Reflect, Refine, and Simplify
4.  Organize and Review

Let’s explore these in more detail so you can put this to work today.
