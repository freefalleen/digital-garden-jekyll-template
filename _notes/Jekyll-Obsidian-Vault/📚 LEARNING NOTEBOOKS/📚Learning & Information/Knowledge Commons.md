>A commons is any unregulated resource open to all, most traditionally associated with the atmosphere, oceans, and unclaimed territory such as Antarctica. However, in our information age, we need to think of commons more capaciously, including not only physical spaces, but also the knowledge spaces of society such as the internet and data archives.

>Most information infrastructures fall short of the ideal of ‘open access,’ being restrictive either in the tools or know-how required to utilize them. The outcome is a fragmentation of the information available, an impoverished lens on the system being studied, and imbalances of knowledge. Asymmetries in information/knowledge access create asymmetries and imbalances that reach across a community. 

>A knowledge commons is a core ‘technology’ (defined to include both hardware/software and cultural technologies) of the solution for a more inclusive, open, and equitable population. In this participatory ecosystem, the whole community maintains and evolves the shared space. I believe that the path towards creating this commons lies in an embrace of radical collaboration, new scales of interaction, and the corresponding changes (in thinking, in community structure, and in support) that must accompany this movement [_[McGranaghan et al.](https://knowledgestructure.pubpub.org/pub/space-knowledge-commons)_[, 2022](https://knowledgestructure.pubpub.org/pub/space-knowledge-commons)]. 

>To the extent that information is central to societal flourishing, governing the knowledge commons is the challenge that we must solve. Few have provided more luminous thinking about governing commons spaces than Nobel laureate, Elinor Ostrom. How we adapt her pioneering ideas around physical commons to the information sphere is an open question. In this conversation, I love the work the Mozilla community is doing. We need not be subject to the tragedy of the commons in our knowledge spaces.
