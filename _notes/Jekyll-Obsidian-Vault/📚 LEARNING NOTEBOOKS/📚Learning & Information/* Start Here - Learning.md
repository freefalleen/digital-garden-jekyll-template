Personalized Learning Maps 
The idea of structuring your learning, some form of what I perceive as a **Learning OS** put forward by Krish [here](https://www.notion.so/Requests-for-Rabbitholes-e79e696f223f4eee8e3481dc19e2a005 ). 
Another good example [here](https://robust-emoji-35a.notion.site/Start-here-0e4dc999215748cc920762e67701e9eb) 
I found it a good place to start for a few reasons: 
- it provides ways to think about the learning (eg. mapping a possibility space, mapping a problem space)
- 12 specific prompts and more sources for you to check out some potential rabbit holes for yourself 

What my challenges are 
- scattered energies: being interested in many things at the same time, and not being able to focus my energies. I would say this is 90% of the problem. Because I am scattered, I often do not spend sufficient time on one thing or one thread of thought to go deep into something -- sufficiently deep such that I am able to make connections and ask better questions.
