title: Language

I encounter 2 situations rather frequently while trying to learn something or pursue a curiosity. 

There are many things, during the learning process, that I realize I do not have words for. That often results in a fair amount of hair-pulling, or kinda like groping around in the dark. How does one learn? One puts together some words that supposedly come close to what we are looking for, and then hopes to find something related to that. It is an approximation. 
It is hard to know, at first, if the language and words you use, are indeed what has been written and indexed on the internet or the library or wherever learning takes place. 

Often times, it takes a little while of noodling around, pacing somewhat haphazardly in a semantically ill-defined space, before the boundaries and the referential things become much clearer. Semantically stronger. 


I could keep reading the same word, yet still do not know what the hell it is referring to, except that the people I look up to seem to keep going on about it. For example? [[Cybernetics]] is one example.
