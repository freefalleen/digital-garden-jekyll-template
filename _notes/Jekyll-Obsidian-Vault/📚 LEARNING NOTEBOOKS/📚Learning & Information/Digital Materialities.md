I guess there is this part of me that likes illuminating all the things that we don't naturally see. Invisible infrastructures. 

Can we refer to this as digital-infrastructure-literacy? 

If one does not already know how information is uploaded, hosted, served, and transmitted -- that is, the way information travels -- it is not readily accessible to the imagination, then it is fair to say that one does not know how to question because the boundaries to this amorphous architecture is fuzzy. One does not have the handles nor the language to be able to ask questions. One does not know what she does not know. 

Anyhow, this is not the place and time to ramble. 

I've recently, in the last 2-3 months, learnt about the [materiality of the digital infrastructure](https://comment.org/the-materiality-of-digital-culture/). There are many things that are invisible to us, not because they are intentionally concealed. 

> "We become enamored of the lightness of being sustained by digital media. And all the while, we imagine this digital realm as something that exists “out there” in an ethereal world of bits and data. Meanwhile, the material infrastructure that makes digital culture possible is built on extractive processes that disfigure and poison the land. The myth of immateriality veils the very real material depredations on which it depends."

> The “cloud” metaphor only reinforces the idea of immateriality. But, once more, the truth is more complicated. The cloud is a metaphor for a thoroughly material infrastructure that makes cloud computing possible. Our data exists in massive data centres distributed throughout the world and made up of servers, routers, switches, and miles of cables, as well as redundant power sources, cooling and ventilation systems, and security apparatus.

Our phones too, come from the earth. 

(It is on revisiting this article that I realize this article is written by L.M.Sacasas, he writes a newsletter -- containing many commentaries on technology and Ivan Illich -- that I greatly appreciate.)

Shannon Mattern (someone whose work I find especially admirable, and also intriguing) researches and speaks about media infrastructure, of which I have plans to dig into, one day. 

Thinking about how we are always implicated makes my skin crawl. Reading [Against Purity - Living Ethically in Compromised Times](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/against-purity) a few years ago reminds me, and has stayed with me all this time, it is that we are almost always implicated, and in some way complicit. Is being informed part of *doing the work*? Is speaking out part of it? Is there a moral high ground we can claim we tread on, and from where we speak? I do not know. We can, however, know what is the right thing to do, albeit vaguely, occasionally. We can conduct our lives in a way that is as non-violent as possible. That is my belief.
