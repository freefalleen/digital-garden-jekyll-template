You need a spatial social environment to have random and unpredictable interactions. The best part of a conference? Always the breaks.""

Someone I spoke to recently told me, I hardly use google anymore. I use it for recipes.

Sari Azout talks about needing more boutique search engines. As we speak, we are witnessing the rise of curation-as-a-service (CaaS). Wow, not another -aas. I hear you, i hear you, but bear with me, i'm using it only as a reference, to lay the groundwork for my thesis. 

# The rise of curation
The rise of curation came about because the information in the world is just getting too much. Have you heard of the creator's economy? Almost everyone with an internet connection and enough time on their hands, enough will, is able to put anything online. They can be a creator. The more content there is, the more noise. There you have it. Where does that leave us? As someone going online to look for something useful to us for a research, for to how-to-do-X, looking for some guides or great perspective on something, this means wading through tonnes of listings, page after page, not quite knowing if this search will be fruitful. 

We do that on our own sometimes, through social media. We follow certain people on facebook, good fellas we've identified as the movers and shakers - individuals we've identified as holding valuable perspectives (granted, sometimes due to clout ie. metrics engineered into platforms). We create lists on Twitter, we become super followers. More and more so, platforms have provided options where we're able to easily rank and put the people we follow into tiers. We're being aided in our sieving process here. Because they know. It's clear we need a mechanism because it is all getting too much.

Curation as a solution 
Every complaint is a niche market. And here we are with a clear problem - an info overload. An curation proposed as a solution to that problem. 


Curation as a strategy 

# Do you not want to do the work yourself?

Optimized for time. Sales of Nat Eliason's second brain
We outsource our ability to sieve wheat from chaff to metrics, and then now to curators
Sometimes I wonder though, is this leaning towards a curation 


# Can anyone be a curator? 
Who is qualified. Are you automatically a curator because you say you are? Truth be told, there really is no gatekeeping, but the results speak for itself. 



What we're getting less of though, is serendipity. 

# Algorithms get in the way of serendipity. 
But I want to be clear. Serendipity does not means chance encounters, merely random, in the true nature of both words. We remember and talk about serendipity often in the context that something fruitful has come out of it. We come upon ideas that surprise us, interesting people, projects, prospects, doors opening, mind-expanding, body-tingling experiences. Not just mere chance, random things. So in this sense, i'm talking about meeting someone at an event at the museum, seated next to him/her, striking up a conversation during the intermission after the movie, and before the panel discussion, and then discovering oh you have some common friends, and oh you do have some common interests, reading the same books, asking the same questions well you get the drift. 

Algorithms predict and steer. How does one get off the boat when you don't know you're on it. Motion sickness. Do you feel it?

I am still not sure we are able to do that on our digital platforms. of course we do not have to try to mirror interactions irl at every chance possible but the fact that some people are trying and some people are longing (me) tells you about the desire. 



and discoverability 

you don't know what you don't know so you can't search for it 
- designing for serendipity (Startupy)
- designing for serendipity via connections (but that is limited by degrees of connection)
- another online search engine currently in beta (google hiro isono)

you don't know what it's called, so you cannot look for it through words. how do you articulate a vibe 
- same energy

(from startupy https://www.bvp.com/atlas/roadmap-curating-the-internet to read)

on the internet, the mode of navigation is text based. 
the embodiment, the ability to inhabit space in a physical area lends itself well to serendipity

on the internet, if you don't know the words for it, you cannot be there. 

no desire paths show up 


a preference for niche kills serendipity 

I keep advocating for serendipity because i think it is the key to enchantment. 

Desires paths 
- where others would like to go and they have found a more efficient way of getting there 
- they present a point of decision making and personal negotiation between the people who encounter it and the people who have gone before them
