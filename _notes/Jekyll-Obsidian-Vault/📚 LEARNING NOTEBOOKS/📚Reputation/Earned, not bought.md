> Reputation should not be traded. **_Ever._** That’s not what it is for. It is bound to an identity and is only meaningful when it continues to be bound to that identity. If I can buy or spend reputation rather than earning it by performing in the way the reputation currency indicates, then it is a meaningless signal that has broken loose from any sense that the reputation is supposed to impart.

Thinking we can talk about it along with why radar is implementing badges/NFTs to signal membership, affiliation and contribution. 

That it can be bought, sold, transacted, loses its value as a signal of affiliation, membership, contribution. 


how we think about badges 

celebrating participation milestones together 
token of appreciation, recognizing contributions 
how long someone is with a group - dynamic NFTs
not always a flex of achievement, not always an assessment 
participation in certain seasons 

i'm thinking something along the lines of, because we understand that there are 4 drivers/motivations, this shapes the way configuration/constellation of tools used. 
the badge is not always a medium of flex
the gifting of a badge is a medium of recognizing and acknowledging contribution
