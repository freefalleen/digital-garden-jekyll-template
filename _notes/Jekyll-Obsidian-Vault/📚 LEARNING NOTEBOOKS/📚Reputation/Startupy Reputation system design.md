## Reputation, by its very nature, comes into being one of two ways: 1) it is spoken into being from nothing by declaration (like you are my _friend_, Bob is _employee of the month_, Jane is our _Office Manager_) or 2) it is derived from measurable performance of actions (like a score on a test, measuring how often you log into a web site, or counting votes in an election). The first case is complete fiat, the second is threshold determined by another currency (grades, votes, web log statistics, etc.)

Often reputation currencies are only able to be issued <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">by virtue of a relationship or a kind of expertise or authority.</mark> And in this case, that’s exactly how you want them to work.

It is bound to an identity and is only meaningful when it continues to be bound to that identity . If I can buy or spend reputation rather than earning it by performing in the way the reputation currency reputes, then it is a meaningless indicator that has broken loose from any meaning that the reputation is supposed to have.

It is totally valid, however, for reputation systems to have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a valid lifetime after which they expire</mark>.... connected to metrics of activity in the last year or six months, so that the currency is more relevant to current levels of performance rather than some historical hall of fame.




Highly-rated reads in each topic area (great to make it a feature of onboarding as recommended reads)

# Request 
We need to design a reputation system for Startupy that properly accounts for both quality and quantity of contributor activities.

## Goals: 
- incentivizing curation inputs, patterns
- reward and distribute the rewards that comes from good curation, authorship (the ability to track and trace)
- nice to have: make less-known curators and authors and topics discoverable 

# Existing devices for signaling (flows into what constitutes reputation)
- Likes / Reactions (responses are great, seen, supported etc)
- Upvotes, downvotes
- Review
- Recommendations 
- In X people's to read/to use list (like in X people's cart)
- Followed by / followers, 
- > follow a content, 
- > follow a person's curation of a content, 
- > follow a person 
- > Downsides of a follow system, we end up with a feed system. is this where we want to end up? does the experience of a feed of curated content make the experience more worthy and less trashy ie. will we end up in the same situation of endless scrolling and information overload? 

# How do we rank or create a feedback loop on the quality of content?
- quality as in Sari's idea would be a piece of content that has many connections 

# Incentivizing consistency
ideal: curators who stick around because they are also users who find value in the content of here 

how do we collect, store, and contextualize the information we consume?

# Incentivizing curation of less-curated topic areas?

# Incentivizing diversity of sources?

value chain / funnel: discover - learn (read) - integrate/consolidate/contextualize 

Community: come for the content, stay for the community -- learning 
Learning: curators who are also users 

Rather than saying these are the best people 
Top Curators;  Go to ____Jane____ for _____Community Design___
Currently Watching; these are the topics Jane is currently interested in  

Reputation system still designed around recency and quickness ?

what do we want to reward / encourage? 
--- thoughtfulness
--- meaning making, context, how might that be expressed without user's text input?
--- consistency (curated this month / charts of content curated) , duration (curating since...)
--- diversity of topics --> rewarding curation for less-curated topic areas? (require bundling of topic areas)
--- diversity of sources on those topics (discovery, relatively unknown people)


what do we want to signal - numbers or descriptors 
are these signals useful?  
what are the implications of these signals? ie. what do they encourage? 

top curators in this area --- quantity
effects - to be visible, curators focus on numbers, quality drops?
caveat - does the visibility / reputation matter to the curators? or is this intrinsically motivated?

how can we reward? 

## Management of a few key factors (reliable ways of signalling, recognition to incentivize)
- Consistent content 
- Good content 
- An opportunity to be discovered ie. not obscured by the metrics of choice (top curators, best content, best authors) - recency feed allows for that 

What signals do we want to use?

How do we know these signals are helpful?

What are the possible implications of these signals (other than the desired effect hypothesized)

How to design this review system?


# what would curators or authors see linked to them? what would be useful?
- frequently curating in ... (reflected via the frequency contributed to a topic)
- top curator "on a roll" (most contributions in a certain topic) 
- > caveat; recency vs curators who have not been curating recently 
- favourite (most highly ranked/read) - signals reputation 

# the ability to track and trace

## Collective Media Markup Language 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H55a5TncjaXhyBi9Bf-Uwslce5_FRhOY3BUk5t1rbRg/edit 
#### Overview 
Collective Media Markup Language (CMML) provides a framework for developing socially important metadata regarding specific media items and selected elements within those items.  Such media markup languages can facilitate the development, stewardship and curation of richly informative collective media directories, repositories and wikis, greatly enhancing the networking and navigability of related data.  They can provide root grammars, or pattern languages, for developing highly distributive and modularized digital networking, including technical integrations between different tech systems and stacks.

CMML can enable authorized media users to identify perceived traits as attributes which they personally attach to specific media items, and selections thereof, for these purposes: 
- Assigning metadata tags:  Personally assigning (binary or dimensional) [attributive tags](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H55a5TncjaXhyBi9Bf-Uwslce5_FRhOY3BUk5t1rbRg/edit#heading=h.vfqrwchmsp5c), including semantic links
- Evaluating tag assignments:  [Evaluating](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H55a5TncjaXhyBi9Bf-Uwslce5_FRhOY3BUk5t1rbRg/edit#heading=h.wvkjfszhu9to) tags which have already been assigned 
- Structured conversation:  Attaching (potentially threaded or [structured](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H55a5TncjaXhyBi9Bf-Uwslce5_FRhOY3BUk5t1rbRg/edit#heading=h.w29a8ofyu5lv)) verbal commentary/conversation
#### Of interest
- Tagging of User-generated Content
- Evaluative Scales and Reaction-Types
- Links to **[Consensus Calculus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G8ZLHB3ZjAoBqiykwOzFWBoAgma9viCT9Np0fyaSxsA/edit#heading=h.nphscgqjmwnq)**


## Distributive Governance Framework ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cU0557pbNOAI2eco2Ura3HXdxC2v-SJBWMHYaGMHMtA/edit))
Good for looking at roles: guest, member, steward
"a consent-based model such as [Distributive Governance Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cU0557pbNOAI2eco2Ura3HXdxC2v-SJBWMHYaGMHMtA/edit?usp=sharing) to establish participation roles, rights and responsibilities per each digital identity and-- when desired, and manageable- per each unique individual.**"

## Semantic Co-Rating ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VTR1QFY6ifeMp0WxeTHr59sVAfbjt6lXwxk1faglSm8/edit#heading=h.ga4l931e3umd))
(Semantic Co-Rating is a component of [Collective Media Markup Language](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H55a5TncjaXhyBi9Bf-Uwslce5_FRhOY3BUk5t1rbRg/edit?usp=sharing))

Semantic co-rating is, at its core, a simple evaluative concept.  Its main conceptual bases are [tag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata))-based organization and [folksonomy](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy).  Semantic co-rating aims to actualize the deep potentials of user-generated broad folksonomies.

The concept: Media network items and metadata tags (per each intentionally supported language) are 'co-rated' according to their contextual relationships with each other.  All user ratings reflect the perceived relationships of tags to items or of items to tags. This can facilitate the collective emergence of digital media vocabularies, grammars, and virtually 'localized' dialects.
