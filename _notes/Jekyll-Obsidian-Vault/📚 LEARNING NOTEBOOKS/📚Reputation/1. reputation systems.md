reputation is a language 

" One of the biggest questions being pondered by many in crypto is how people start accruing social capital natively in web3 and have it acknowledged across the ecosystem.

In many ways, our reputation as a proof of history already exists, but we donâ€™t uniformly believe in a reputation system that can change our behaviors for using applications. Reputation systems are sort of like languages. We must all believe in them to be true. So how do we start getting consensus on a standard of reputation?" https://jammsession.substack.com/p/will-social-capital-ever-matter-in?s=r&sort=new

Why this is problematic: reputation is not something that requires consensus. But rather, its richness is defined by context. 


POAPs 
Credentials are only valuable to the extent they are trusted. This is why an HR department will call your alma mater to verify your degree, or a previous employer to verify your position and performance.(https://30000feet.substack.com/p/issue-41-poaps-and-transferability?s=r)
- authority. off-chain, we rely on institutions and their ability to bestow credentials as a mark of significance. Significance requires, of course, societal's agreement, a social contract that collective agrees on the legitimacy and credibility of the institution doing the endorsement, and consequently, the status of the individual. For example getting a degree from a university or an accredited educational body.
