instead of what's happening now on social media where we go to the same place to read the news, be entertained, see what our friends are doing, what our families are doing, what the celeb the politician the public figure is saying, what they are sharing and liking and remembering. a mess is what it is. 
we talk about being connected with others. on which platform does that seem more likely? 

currently lack nuance, the only signalling is presence ie. POAPS.
having people vouch for people! endorsements. "5 stars, but 2 reviews" 
a mix of both objective and subjective measures 
The power of context! How do we represent that in a way that it's useful

assign meaning, assign context to this behaviour.

humpty: 
we oversimplify or overcomplicate reputation 
reputation as a blanket statement, who we are and what it enables
