The process of self-directed learning is one of meandering, putting a nose to the air, eager to tell one scent apart from another, following its traces.

To have faith in this flavour of learning is to understand and practice patience. 
It is neither efficient nor necessarily fruitful, and one that is committed to this path of learning needs to contend with that.
It is a process that favours those with the luxury of time. 

One also needs to be faithful, and contend with the possibility that there is nothing to show for awhile because composting is a slow process. Fermentation is a slow process. There may not be explosions or bangs.
