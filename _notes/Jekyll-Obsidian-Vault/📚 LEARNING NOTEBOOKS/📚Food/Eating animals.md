there is something hard to stomach when i talk to a farmer and expect to hear care and don't sense it coming. i find it hard to trust them. but i talk myself out of judgement. 

i keep reserving my judgement when it comes to meat-eating. not meat-eaters, but rather the act of consuming meat

we keep coming up against situations when we have to weigh the act of eating meat against all the criteria we hold in our heads, and it's becoming quite a regular thing to do, going down that list. it became familiar. 

Do we eat meat? 

Is it raised in factory cruel conditions? 
what if we Kill it ourselves? we probably cannot bring ourselves to do that. 
fish? 

i've been thinking about how we come to regard the process of taking lives. I've met people who talk about specism to make a point about how dogs as pets vis a vis eating cows, if you find it appalling to think about eating your fur babies, why would you eat a cow. then that raises the question of whether we think plants are more acceptable when it comes to having their lives being taken away. can you see the slippery slope already ahead? should we eat animals and only those that do not feel pain? those that are "lower-order" and are sustained by some different nervous system? 

but, isn't life taken all the time, in nature, energy transformed from one form to another, by way of giving itself over, or rather taken, to sustain another life, and then another, and then another, eventually it all comes around. it seems almost weird to be thinking about choosing or pricing one life above another, or that one is sacrificed for the other, if we see that it all comes around to feed "my kind". my offsprings, if you will

buying free range eggs at the grocery store, grappling with the price. and then one day, also realizing that now, there is an added category of free run. indoor free running chickens. free range, outdoors free running chickens. and then there are also eggs from caged chickens. other than the usual price tag stuck below the products, we see an additional label being made, handwritten, "CAGED CHICKENS" with an arrow points down at the suspects held by the shelves below. Is that supposed to bring guilt? 

fish, killing it
