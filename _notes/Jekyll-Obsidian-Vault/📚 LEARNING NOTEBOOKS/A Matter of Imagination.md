Imagination as an imperative 
As a manifesto 
Imagination Infrastructure 

I will always remember the look on the child's face, helpless, lost, confused. 
With the object in his hand, which we named *toy* -- and I'm guessing clearly he didn't think so -- he asked us in his tiny voice, *how to play*

" The war against imagination is the only one the capitalists have managed to win."

The impossibility of [walking away](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40604388-walkaway) and walking out. 

I believe we are reclaiming that space through speculative futures. 

> “ Imagination is foundational, and it is in short supply. Strictly as a working term, imagination is still frowned upon in conventional business and policy circles. So-called serious people prefer more serious words. Selecting terms like innovation and disruption over imagination. The language of innovation and disruption emerges from the technology/Silicon Valley operating system. It is a system so dominant we scarcely notice it. Despite our overuse of the word, what passes for innovation nowadays couldn’t be further from it. Most innovation is satisfied tinkering on the edge of industrial age ideas, systems, and technology. There is a concerted effort to use technology to further entrenchment and exploit people and the planet. But pure imagination, the seemingly limitless manner we can make leaps from one condition of being and understanding to another, remains elusive. This is especially true if imagination is to be used to solve big intractable problems or to operate outside of the market dynamics. Without the capacity to imagine a different future, it is difficult to see how to create it” — Philip McKenzie (2022)

>“ The exercise of imagination is dangerous to those who profit from the way things are because it has the power to show that the way things are is not permanent, not universal, not necessary.” — Ursula K. LeGuin

How does this relate to possible futures?
