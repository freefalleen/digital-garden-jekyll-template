title: Spatial Interfaces irl and url

This echoes a little like that line from the poem " all watched over by machines of loving grace".

As usual, and as has been the case recently, I find myself constantly thinking about the divide between the meatspace and digital space. How should one say that one is more real than the other? If the connections and communities and engagement and so much more of our lives are mediated by screens and platforms and protocols, how valid is the screentime-is-bad trope?

Can I stand by "unplug to thrive"? Or is that a mere and obsolete belief?

>All those who enter must come alone.
>Simply, Castells posits that the divide between local, real world spaces (like cafes, libraries, and sidewalks) and global, digital spaces (like websites, tweets, and phone calls) constitutes a fracture in our information processing capacity. The places where we eat, vote, and stroll are separated from the places where we read, write, and talk. The digitally mediated world where so much of our discourse now echos is too distant from the every day places where we buy bagels and chat with waitresses. And this is a problem.
>Our computers connect people globally and separate them locally. Part of the reason why they separate us in physical space is because the physical languages that we use to communicate with them are too different from the physical languages that we use to communicate with each other.
>The richness behind those cafe laptops is private; 
> We can create hybrid spaces where groups of people can interact with digital objects, physical objects, and each other using a shared physical language that is both legible and scalable.
> We can now imagine a future where there are no more interfaces, where Weiser's vision of calm computing becomes possible—a vision of human computer interactions that are both as peaceful and information dense as a walk in the woods [[link](http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/SciAmDraft3.html)].
> We can imagine a mature interface language where we will no longer have to learn two dozen new commands for every gadget we buy, where instead we use a universal physical/gestural language that is body/space centric and not device/screen obsessed. It's a nice dream; a nascent future, full of possibility . . . in this dream the space of place and space of flows will no longer be so different—the digital world will emerge from its cloisters and take full citizenship in physical life. Simple things will change: intimate cellphone conversations on buses will only be as rude as the susurrus of married couples on airplanes, every sweater in your closet will have a url, and hands-free headsets will no longer be so dorky. We'll
