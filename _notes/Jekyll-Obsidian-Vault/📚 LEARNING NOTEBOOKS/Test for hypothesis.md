Loss of [[agency]]

# Essay: The digital death of collecting

My lostness comes from the sense that our cultural collections are not wholly our own anymore. In the era of algorithmic feeds, it’s as if the bookshelves have started changing shape on their own in real time, shuffling some material to the front and downplaying the rest like a sleight-of-hand magician trying to make you pick a specific card — even as they let you believe it’s your own choice. And this lack of agency is undermining our connections to the culture that we love.

It goes back to the significance of the bookshelf: When we didn’t have access to automated feeds and streaming platforms, we had to decide for ourselves which culture to keep close by.

I flipped through them aimlessly when deciding what to play on my portable discman, my range of choices limited to what I already owned but also deepened because I had a relationship to every disc in the binder. I still have nostalgic memories of that binder; I can feel the texture of the case and the sense of possibility that it held in my mind.

In the era of the algorithmic feed, these platforms have become the containers for our cultural artifacts as well as for our cultural experiences.

I could be listening to anything, so why should any one thing be important to me?


This echoes once again the symbolic act of collecting something on the internet, that [[the single act of collecting]] is what we experience as love, an experience that very much transcends the frivolous gestures of *likes*. 

> The constructive relationship between consumer and culture goes in both directions. When we find something meaningful enough to save, to collect it, the action both etches it a little deeper into our hearts and it also creates a context around the artifact itself, whether song, image, or video — and context not just for ourselves but for other people, the shared context of culture at large.

“The phenomenon of collecting loses its meaning as it loses its personal owner.”

“Only in extinction is the collector comprehended,” he wrote, prematurely mourning the loss of a lifestyle and an identity that he held dear for himself as much as anyone else. Yet even with all its excesses of content, our era of algorithmic feeds might herald the actual death of the collector, because the algorithm itself is the collector, curator, and arbiter of culture. Not only does that represent a loss of agency and control, it’s also a loss of feeling.

The placelessness and self-erasure of digital platforms and the enforced passivity of the algorithmic feed have removed these experiences.
