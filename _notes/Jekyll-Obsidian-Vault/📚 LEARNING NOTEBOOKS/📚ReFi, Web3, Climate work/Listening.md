**Listening as a creative practice 

[[Projects that explore sound as ecology]] 

It's interesting to me because conventional ways of experiencing the world seems to visual. Visually, you may be able scan something quickly, for keywords. You might have read about the way people read online -- the scroll made possible by thumb flicks 

[[Decolonization and creative practice]]
> listening as a creative practice that might function decolonially - how so? ([here](https://www.crisap.org/research/projects/wild-energies-live-materials/workshop/)) questions concerning ethics of listening – in socio-political, environmental, embodied, and queer practices of listening within situated contexts.


> _Listening After Nature_ ([link](https://www.bloomsbury.com/ca/listening-after-nature-9781501354519/)) examines the constructions and erasures that haunt field recording practice and discourse. Analyzing archival and contemporary soundworks through a combination of post-colonial, ecological and sound studies scholarship, Mark Peter Wright recodes the Field; troubles conceptions of Nature; expands site-specificity; and unearths hidden technocultures. What exists beyond the signal? How is agency performed and negotiated between humans and nonhumans? What exactly is a field recording and what are its pedagogical potentials?  
  
>These questions are operated by a methodology of listening that incorporates the spaces of audition, as well as Wright's own practice-based reflections. In doing so, _Listening After Nature_ posits a range of novel interventions. One example is the “Noisy-Nonself,” a conceptual figuration with which to comprehend the presence of reticent recordists. “Contact Zones and Elsewhere Fields” offers another unique contribution by reimaging the relationship between the field and studio. In the final chapter, Wright explores the microphone by tracing its critical and creative connections to natural resource extraction and contemporary practice.  
  
>_Listening After Nature_ auditions water and waste, infrastructures and animals, technologies and recordists, data and stars. It grapples with the thresholds of sensory perception and anchors itself to the question: what am I not hearing? In doing so, it challenges Western universalisms that code the field whilst offering vibrant practice-based possibilities.
