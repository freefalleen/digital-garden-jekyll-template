-   Practice a slow approach to fast making

the idea of slow futures 

slow cities - a full cultural movement 

slow web 

fetishization of  
made for the scroll and the swipe 

#### Not everyone can afford to do slow, or soft
the softpower of japan, and occasionally china 
the slowness of scandinavian landscapes 
hygge culture 
backcountry whatever. 

to endorse and lean towards that 
is to draw away from loud, chaotic, unpredictable. 

can we decouple our visual imageries of care, tenderness and affection from the slowness we think about?
privileged and inaccessible, do we leave it at that?
