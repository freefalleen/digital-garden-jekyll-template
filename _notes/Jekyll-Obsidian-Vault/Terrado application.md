My background is in Psychology. 

I care deeply about the health and resilience of human and natural systems and have pursued my interest in this area over the last 10 years. My professional experiences have largely been grounded in community engagement and partnership roles. I have worked in the youth, education and social innovation sector. Through volunteering stints and side projects, I have been engaged in discussions around food systems and regenerative agriculture, involved in storytelling and building communities around these areas. My interest in understanding and designing for flourishing systems have led me to create opportunities for gathering.

I see myself as an enabler and a facilitator and I hope to bring my experience to encourage greater awareness and more climate-positive initiatives.

Connecting people and creating spaces for cross-pollination of ideas is something I find extremely rewarding. Outside of my professional roles, I have also actively participated in and supported various community projects, most of which are related to sustainability.

 working together with a team of individuals who are driven and committed to cultivate systems that are inclusive, equitable, and sustainable.
