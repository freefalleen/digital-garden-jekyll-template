Sometimes i think about the people who walk away. The ones who disappear. 
  

Occasionally someone rises from evening meal 
Goes outside, and goes, and goes, and goes...
Because somewhere in the east a sanctuary stands 
And his children lament as though he had died. 
And another, who dies within his house 
Remains there, remains amid dishes and glasses 
So that his children must enter the world 
In search of that sanctuary, which he forgot 
-   Rainer Maria Rilke

In a way, it is related to my question about whether it is possible to walk away from the game, even if you know it is a game
